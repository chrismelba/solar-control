# Home Assistant Add-on: Solar Control

## About

This add-on provides solar control functionality for Home Assistant.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

When started it will print the configured message or "Hello world" in the log.

It will also print "All done!" in `/share/solar_control_output.txt` to show
simple example of the usage of `map` in addon config.
